# Electricity-Billing-System

Electricity Billing System is a project which is created for the admins- the electricity billing officer or the employees which generate the electricity bill for the customers, so as to ease the overall process of generating the bill for the admins or the bill providers.
Java is the majorly used programming language in the project along with Structured Query Language, popularly known as SQL for interacting with the database along with the contained tables. 

### Categorically, major sections which are contained in the project are as follows:- 
#### 1) Admin page: Sole motive of the admin page is to verify the details of the admins who are trying to login by comparing the details entered with the details present in the login table.

#### 2) Home page: If successful login takes place, then the admin would be directed to the home page which contains 4 more sections which are as follows:
##### 1*] Master- Contains 2 options which are New Customer and Customer details- New Customer would be used by the admin when the admin has to create a new customer i.e to add details of a non- existing customer to the database and customer details would essentially be used by the admin to display and print all the customer details which are present in the customer details table in the database. 
##### 2*] User- Contains Pay Bill option which would be used by the admin to pay the bill of the customer. Once the bill has been paid, the details would then be stored in the database which would be fetched at the time of bill generation. 
##### 3*] Report- Contains an option to generate bill which would be generated on the basis of meter number and month. Once these details have been entered, details corresponding to that specific meter number and month would be displayed on the screen which could then be printed or downloaded on the admins printer or laptop and would be given to that customer. 
##### 4*] Exit- As the name suggests, used to exit the application.
